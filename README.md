# Human-Detection-App

This project was my own take on building a human detection app using Tensorflow.JS which the code was heavily inspired by [ipenywis](https://github.com/ipenywis)'s [react-object-detection](https://github.com/ipenywis/react-object-detection) project.

## Packages
This software uses CocoSSD from [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).
<br />
Additionally, it also uses styled-component package in order to conveniently style components within the software.

## Clone & Deployment
For clone & deployment, simply get to a directory and type these commands into the terminal
``` Linux
$ git clone https://github.com/nhatnguyen9813/human-detection-app.git
$ cd human-detection-app
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
